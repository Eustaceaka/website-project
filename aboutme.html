    <h1>About Eustace</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Hello, my name is Eustace and I am a leadership specialist and researcher in the field of positive psychology and self development. I am also the founder of Inspire Love Foundation.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>My mission in life is to help those who have lost hope and faith in their ability to shape their destiny to take back control of their life choices and finding meaning in their lives. I want to help people stay focused, hit the targets they aim for and find fulfillment in everyday life. I have several management qualifications and a Masters in Business Administration</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Currently, I am in the process of transitioning into the tech industry. The reason for this is because the world is becoming increasingly digitized, and I would like to use technology to make life easier for others by creating software programs for them. I enjoy the fact that software development provides the opportunity to be challenged and to learn something new every day--ranging from fixing bugs, entering information into database, to developing games. Also, this career path is so flexible that I can choose to work remotely or in a work environment. Likewise, Software developers are high in demand and this appeals to me as well.</p>
